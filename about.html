   <div class="aboutmc">  <h1>...</h1><h2>Mortal/Cut is a creative association of workers in the video and design industry.<br>
     
     The association calls itself a team of working talents, under the protection of each other and the law. <br><br>
The first video editing was sold in the 2009th year. After 10 years, the first video clip was created and directed. 
     Now we are engaged in the design of visual images, strategy, production and high-quality technical execution of the video.
Every day we are exploring the direction, screenwriting, production, visual design, art and music development.<br><br>

Joining the team is possible if you use the form in the upper right part of the screen.<br>
If you want to create something with us or you are a specialized lawyer then write,  the chances are doubled...</h2>
